Phase 1: The Core AI Upgrade - Interactive Document Analysis (RAG)
Goal: Transform the app from a passive summarizer into an interactive research tool. This phase is all about implementing the core RAG pipeline.

1A. Foundation - Database & Vector Store:

Action: Set up a PostgreSQL database. Add the pgvector extension to handle vector storage. Create users and documents tables to prepare for future features.

Skill: Full-stack development with a relational database.

1B. Backend - The RAG Pipeline:

Action: On PDF upload, chunk the text, create vector embeddings for each chunk, and store them in your pgvector table, linked to the document's ID.

Skill: Implementing the core components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

1C. Backend - The "Chat" Endpoint:

Action: Create a POST /chat endpoint that takes a question, converts it to a vector, retrieves relevant text chunks from the database, and feeds them to the Gemini API to generate a context-aware answer.

Skill: Building a complete, stateful AI reasoning loop.

1D. Frontend - The Chat UI:

Action: Replace the static summary display with a chat interface.

Skill: Building modern, interactive user interfaces in React.

Resume Bullet: "Developed a full-stack AI application implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with FastAPI and a PostgreSQL/pgvector database to enable users to chat interactively with PDF documents."

Phase 2: Building a Production-Grade, Multi-User Application
Goal: Evolve the tool into a persistent, personalized service that is robust enough for real-world use.

2A. Backend - User Authentication:

Action: Implement user sign-up, login, and secure session management. Associate document uploads with the logged-in user.

Skill: Authentication, security, and user data management.

2B. Frontend - Document Library & User Dashboard:

Action: Create a dashboard where users can view and manage their uploaded documents.

Skill: Building a complete, multi-page user experience with protected routes.

2C. Backend - Asynchronous Processing with Celery & Redis:

Action: Re-architect the PDF processing logic. The API endpoint should now add a "process PDF" job to a Celery task queue backed by Redis. A separate worker service will handle the time-consuming text extraction and embedding.

Skill: Building scalable, resilient backend systems with task queues.

2D. Frontend - Streaming Responses:

Action: Modify the chat endpoint and frontend to stream the LLM's answer token-by-token.

Skill: Advanced asynchronous programming and creating highly responsive UIs.

Resume Bullet: "Re-architected the backend for scalability using a Celery task queue to handle asynchronous document processing, and implemented real-time streaming for AI chat responses to significantly improve user experience."

Phase 3: Advanced AI & External Integrations
Goal: Expand the application's capabilities beyond user-uploaded documents and introduce more sophisticated AI features.

3A. Integration - arXiv API Search:

Action: Build a feature to search the arXiv database from within your app. Allow users to directly "import" a paper, which triggers your backend to download and process it.

Skill: Integrating with third-party, external APIs.

3B. AI - Structured Data Extraction:

Action: When a document is processed, use a specific prompt to make the LLM extract key information (methodology, dataset, etc.) as a structured JSON object and display it clearly in the UI.

Skill: Advanced prompt engineering and controlled LLM output.

3C. AI - Cross-Document Analysis:

Action: Allow users to select multiple documents and ask comparative questions. The backend RAG pipeline will need to retrieve context from all selected documents to answer the question.

Skill: Complex AI reasoning and multi-source information synthesis.

Resume Bullet: "Enhanced the AI's capabilities by integrating with the arXiv API for content ingestion and developing a cross-document analysis feature that allows the LLM to compare and synthesize information from multiple research papers."

Phase 4: Capstone Features - Collaboration & Automation
Goal: Add final, high-impact features that make the tool a truly complete assistant.

4A. Utility - Citation Management:

Action: Automatically extract bibliographies and provide export functionality for citations in standard formats (e.g., BibTeX).

Skill: Data parsing and building practical, workflow-enhancing tools.

4B. Collaboration - Shared Workspaces:

Action: Implement a "projects" feature where multiple users can be invited to a shared space to view and chat with the same set of documents.

Skill: Advanced data modeling for collaborative environments.

4C. Automation - The Literature Review Agent:

Action: Build the proactive AI agent that can take a research topic, find papers, read them, and generate a draft literature review.

Skill: Designing and implementing complex, multi-step AI agentic workflows.

Resume Bullet: "Designed and built a capstone AI agent capable of autonomously performing a literature review by searching academic databases, analyzing multiple papers, and generating a synthesized summary with citations."
