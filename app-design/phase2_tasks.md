Part 1: User Authentication üîê
‚òê Task 1: Add User Model to Database
Goal: Create a User table in the database to store user credentials.

Actions:

Add a User model to backend/database/models.py. It should include fields for id, email, and hashed_password.

Use a library like passlib to handle password hashing.

Generate a new Alembic migration to apply the User table to your database schema.

Definition of Done: The users table with id, email, and hashed_password columns is created in your PostgreSQL database.

‚òê Task 2: Create User Registration Endpoint
Goal: Allow new users to sign up for the application.

Actions:

Create a POST /users/register endpoint in backend/main.py.

The endpoint should accept an email and password, hash the password, and store the new user in the database.

Add validation to prevent duplicate email addresses.

Definition of Done: You can successfully create a new user by sending a POST request to /users/register with a unique email and password.

‚òê Task 3: Implement User Login and JWT Authentication
Goal: Authenticate users and provide them with a JSON Web Token (JWT) for session management.

Actions:

Install python-jose for JWT creation and validation.

Create a POST /users/login endpoint that accepts an email and password.

Verify the user's credentials and, if successful, generate and return a JWT.

Definition of Done: A registered user can log in and receive a valid JWT in response.

‚òê Task 4: Secure an Endpoint
Goal: Protect an endpoint so that only authenticated users can access it.

Actions:

Create a utility function to decode and verify the JWT from the request's Authorization header.

Apply this security dependency to an existing or new endpoint (e.g., a GET /users/me endpoint that returns the current user's email).

Definition of Done: The secured endpoint returns a 401 Unauthorized error for requests without a valid JWT and returns the correct data for authenticated requests.

Part 2: Document Library & User Dashboard üìö
‚òê Task 5: Associate Documents with Users
Goal: Link uploaded documents to the user who uploaded them.

Actions:

Add a user_id foreign key to the Document model in backend/database/models.py.

Generate a new Alembic migration to add the user_id column to the documents table.

Modify the POST /upload endpoint to require authentication and associate the uploaded document with the current user.

Definition of Done: When an authenticated user uploads a document, the new entry in the documents table is correctly linked to their user_id.

‚òê Task 6: Create Endpoint to List User Documents
Goal: Allow users to retrieve a list of all documents they have uploaded.

Actions:

Create a GET /documents endpoint that requires authentication.

The endpoint should query the database for all documents associated with the current user's id.

Return a list of the user's documents.

Definition of Done: Making a GET request to /documents with a valid JWT returns a list of all documents uploaded by that user.

‚òê Task 7: Build the Frontend User Dashboard
Goal: Create a new view in the frontend where users can see and manage their documents.

Actions:

Create a new Dashboard.jsx component that is displayed after a user logs in.

When the component mounts, it should make a GET request to the /documents endpoint.

Display the list of documents, and allow the user to select one to start a chat session.

Definition of Done: A logged-in user can see a list of their uploaded documents on the dashboard.

Part 3: Asynchronous Processing with Celery & Redis üöÄ
‚òê Task 8: Set Up Celery and Redis
Goal: Integrate a task queue to handle long-running processes without blocking the API.

Actions:

Add celery and redis to backend/requirements.txt.

Add a Redis service to your docker-compose.yml file.

Create a new celery_worker.py file in the backend to configure and initialize a Celery instance that uses Redis as its broker.

Definition of Done: The Celery worker can connect to the Redis container, and you can successfully run a simple test task.

‚òê Task 9: Create a PDF Processing Task
Goal: Move the PDF processing logic into a background Celery task.

Actions:

In celery_worker.py, define a new Celery task called process_pdf.

Move all the logic from the /upload endpoint (text extraction, chunking, embedding, and database saving) into this new task.

Definition of Done: The process_pdf task can be called with a document's data and will correctly process and store the document and its text chunks in the database.

‚òê Task 10: Refactor the Upload Endpoint
Goal: Update the /upload endpoint to be fast and non-blocking by delegating work to the Celery task.

Actions:

Modify the POST /upload endpoint so that it now only saves the initial document metadata.

Instead of processing the PDF in the endpoint, call the process_pdf.delay() Celery task, passing the necessary data.

The endpoint should immediately return a response to the user with the document_id and a message that the document is being processed.

Definition of Done: When a user uploads a PDF, the API responds almost instantly, and the PDF processing happens in the background, managed by the Celery worker.

Part 4: Streaming Responses üí®
‚òê Task 11: Modify Backend for Streaming
Goal: Update the /chat endpoint to stream the LLM's response token-by-token.

Actions:

In backend/services/gemini_service.py, modify get_answer_from_gemini to accept a stream=True parameter and yield each chunk of the response as it is received.

In backend/main.py, change the POST /chat endpoint to return a StreamingResponse.

Definition of Done: When you call the /chat endpoint, the response is streamed back in chunks instead of being sent all at once.

‚òê Task 12: Update Frontend to Handle Streaming
Goal: Display the AI's response in the chat window as it is being generated.

Actions:

In frontend/src/App.jsx, modify the handleSendMessage function to handle a streaming response.

Use the ReadableStream API to process the response chunks as they arrive.

Append the incoming text to the latest AI message in the chatHistory state, creating a real-time typing effect.

Definition of Done: When a user asks a question, the AI's answer appears in the chat window token-by-token, providing a much more responsive user experience.
